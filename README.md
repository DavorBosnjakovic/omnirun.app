# Mydevify

### Your computer finally listens.

**Describe it. Build it. Done.**

Mydevify is a desktop app that lets you build software, automate tasks, and control your entire computer — by simply describing what you want. Type or talk. It just works.

That app you've been dreaming about? Build it. Those boring repetitive tasks? Automate them. Want to control your computer from across the room? Just say the word.

No coding required. No developers needed. No limits.

## Key Features

### 💬 Conversational Building
Describe what you want in plain English. Watch it get built in real-time. Review every change before it happens. Approve, reject, or edit.

### 🎨 Dual Mode Interface
- **Simple Mode** — clean and friendly for non-technical users
- **Technical Mode** — terminal, git status, code diffs, full developer experience

### ⏱️ Time Machine
Every change is automatically saved. Go back to any point in your project's history with one click. Every restore is undoable. You literally cannot lose work.

### 📊 Transparent Cost Tracking
See exactly what every AI interaction costs. Input/output token breakdown. Session, monthly, and all-time views. Set budget alerts. No surprise bills.

### 🧠 Project Memory
Leave a project for 6 months. Come back. Mydevify remembers exactly where you left off, what was built, and what was in progress.

### 💻 Built-in Terminal
Full terminal access for power users. Themed to match your app. Command history, ANSI color support, everything you'd expect.

### 🎭 6 Beautiful Themes
Dark, Light, Sepia, Retro, Midnight, High Contrast — every part of the app adapts, including the terminal.

### 🔑 Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
Use your own AI API keys. You control the costs. Our invisible optimization saves you up to 80% on tokens compared to unoptimized tools.
